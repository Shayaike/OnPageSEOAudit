# On-Page SEO Auditor

This project is a CLI based on-page SEO auditor that will evaluate a single page on a website for SEO best practices. It will build a cheat sheet for things to improve and things to review or optimize as a quick way to manage a single page. The goal of the current project is to not have any dependencies and operate with only the built-in Python modules.
